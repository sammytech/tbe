          The CEO, founder and resident producer of Mavin records is an enigmatic personality. Michael Collins Ajereh, although not a solo recording artist himself, has quickly become one of the most gifted, futuristic and prominent showbiz celebrities in Africa. In less than three years of establishing Mavin records, the genius hit music producer who has been dubbed the undisputed king of beats has changed the way Nigerians listen to music with timeless hit tunes of various genre without replicating beats and has revolutionized the industry. He has been called Africa’s answer to Timbaland, another producer with flamboyant beats and a distinctive style. Forbes magazine listed him as the 36th most powerful celebrity in Africa.

Born 1982 in Umuahia, Abia state where his mother comes from and his father from Delta state Nigeria. The young Michael Collins’ family relocated to Lagos where he went through primary, secondary and high school. It was in secondary school that he first acquired the moniker, Don Jazzy. His dad had a background in music business entrepreneurship and was at the fore front of veterans who worked untiringly for the establishment of professional artiste management and corporate music business structures in Nigeria. Although Don Jazzy followed a conventional educational path, he very quickly developed a passion for music and started playing the drums before the age of 4. He went on to start experimenting with various instruments at a tender age, a trait that was to become the hallmark of his later career.

After his high school in 2000 with a business degree, Michael moved to the UK at the invitation of an uncle who wanted him to play the drums for his local church. Various odd jobs followed including working at McDonalds and as a security guard.

Jazzy’s appetite for a full time career in music could no longer be satiated when, in 2004, he partnered with D’Banj to set up the Mo’Hits label. Within two years, the prolific producer had wrapped up two albums (No Long Thing and Rundown/Funk You Up) with his former Mo’Hits partner and was working on a third, Curriculum Vitae. By this time, he had already started becoming a household name with the trademark intro – It’s Don Jazzy again!
In 2008 there were further production credits for the best selling album of that year, The Entertainer. Don Jazzy repeated the feat with Wande Coal’s Mushin 2 MoHits, an album that was described as one of the best albums to ever come out of Nigeria.
